# **Question 1**  

The sample space $\Omega$ is designed as follow:  
&nbsp; 1. It is a set of tuples of 3, each tuple represent an outcome.  
&nbsp; 2. Each tuples contains 3 ordered elements, each elements represent a box in the order of 1, 2 and 3.  
&nbsp; 3. Either of the tuple elements can be an empty list [], representing an empty box.  
&nbsp; 4. Otherwise, each tuple element draws from the list $L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ representing the numbered balls.  
&nbsp; 5. Beside [], each tuple element is an ordered list of number from $L$ with the total number of list elements ranging from 1 to 5, representing 1 to 5 &nbsp;&nbsp; ball(s) in each box.  
&nbsp; 6. The outcome set is a combination of: (0,0,5), (0,1,4), (0,2,3), (0,3,2), (0,4,1), (1,1,4), (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (1,4,1), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), (3,1,1), each &nbsp;&nbsp; tuple representing a way to put 5 balls in each box.  
&nbsp; 7. Note that the order of the balls inside each box--tuple element--does not matter, i.e. ([],[],[1,2,3,4,5]) is the same as ([],[],[2,1,4,3,5]).  

Thus, we have the sample space as follow:  
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \Omega = \{{([], [], [1,2,3,4,5]), ([], [1,2,3,4,5], []), ([1,2,3,4,5], [], []), \\
              ([], [1], [2,3,4,5]), ([], [2], [1,3,4,5]), ([], [3], [1,2,4,5]), ([], [4], [1,2,3,5]), ([], [5], [1,2,3,4]), \\
              ([1], [], [2,3,4,5]), ([2], [], [1,3,4,5]), ([3], [], [1,2,4,5]), ([4], [], [1,2,3,5]), ([5]. [], [1,2,3,4]), \\
              ([1], [2,3,4,5], []), ([2], [1,3,4,5], []), ([3], [1,2,4,5], []), ([4], [1,2,3,5], []), ([5], [1,2,3,4], []),  \\
              ([], [1,2], [3,4,5]), ([], [1,3], [2,4,5]), ([], [1,4], [2,3,5]), ([], [1,5], [2,3,4]), ([], [2,3], [1,4,5]), \\ 
              ([], [2,4], [1,3,5]), ([],[2,5], [1,3,4]), ([], [3,4], [1,2,5]), ([], [3,5], [1,2,4]), ([], [4,5], [1,2,3]), \\
              ([1,2], [], [3,4,5]), ([1,3], [], [2,4,5]), ([1,4], [], [2,3,5]), ([1,5], [], [2,3,4]), ([2,3], [], [1,4,5]), \\
              ([2,4], [], [1,3,5]), ([2,5], [], [1,3,4]), ([3,4], [], [1,2,5]), ([3,5], [], [1,2,4]), ([4,5], [], [1,2,3]), \\
              ([1,2], [3,4,5], []), ([1,3], [2,4,5], []), ([1,4], [2,3,5], []), ([1,5]), [2,3,4], []), ([2,3], [1,4,5], []), \\
              ([2,4], [1,3,5], []), ([2,5], [1,3,4], []), ([3,4], [1,2,5], []), ([3,5], [1,2,4], []), ([4,5], [1,2,3], []), \\
              ([], [1,2,3], [4,5]), ([], [1,2,4], [3,5]), ([], [1,2,5], [3,4]), ([], [2,3,4], [1,5]), ([], [2,3,5], [1,4]), ([], [3,4,5], [1,2])  \\
              ([1,2,3], [], [4,5]), ([1,2,4], [], [3,5]), ([1,2,5], [], [3,4]), ([2,3,4], [], [1,5]), ([2,3,5], [], [1,4]), ([3,4,5], [], [1,2])  \\
              ([1,2,3], [4,5], []), ([1,2,4], [3,5], []), ([1,2,5], [3,4], []), ([2,3,4], [1,5], []), ([2,3,5], [1,4], []), ([3,4,5], [1,2], []) \\
              ([], [1,2,3,4], [5]), ([], [2,3,4,5], [1]), ([], [1,3,4,5], [2]), ([], [1,2,4,5], [3]), ([], [1,2,3,5], [4]), \\
              ([1,2,3,4], [], [5]), ([2,3,4,5], [], [1]), ([1,3,4,5], [], [2]), ([1,2,4,5], [], [3]), ([1,2,3,5], [], [4]), \\
              ([1,2,3,4], [5], []), ([2,3,4,5], [1], []), ([1,3,4,5], [2], []), ([1,2,4,5], [3], []), ([1,2,3,5], [4], []), \\
              ([1], [2], [3,4,5]), ([1], [3], [2,4,5]), ([1], [4], [2,3,5]), ([1], [5], [2,3,4]), \\
              ... \\
              ([1], [2,3], [4,5]), ([1], [2,4], [3,5]), ([1], [2,5], [3,4]) \\
              ... \\
              ([1,2], [3], [4,5]), ([1,2], [4], [3,5]), ([1,2], [5], [3,4])  \\
              ... \}}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We are not listing all combinations because only the combinations with at least one empty box is of our interests for the purpose of this question.  

Based on combinatorial counting methods, we know the number of sequences of length $5$ with $3$ symbols is $n^k = 3^5 = 243$. Thus there are $243$ outcomes in the set $\Omega$.  

## (a) box I remains empty  
The subset of outcomes where box I remains empty is:  
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    A_1 = \{{([], [], [1,2,3,4,5]), ([], [1,2,3,4,5], []), \\
              ([], [1], [2,3,4,5]), ([], [2], [1,3,4,5]), ([], [3], [1,2,4,5]), ([], [4], [1,2,3,5]), ([], [5], [1,2,3,4]), \\
              ([], [1,2], [3,4,5]), ([], [1,3], [2,4,5]), ([], [1,4], [2,3,5]), ([], [1,5], [2,3,4]), ([], [2,3], [1,4,5]), \\ 
              ([], [2,4], [1,3,5]), ([],[2,5], [1,3,4]), ([], [3,4], [1,2,5]), ([], [3,5], [1,2,4]), ([], [4,5], [1,2,3]), \\
              ([], [1,2,3], [4,5]), ([], [1,2,4], [3,5]), ([], [1,2,5], [3,4]), ([], [2,3,4], [1,5]), ([], [2,3,5], [1,4]), ([], [3,4,5], [1,2])  \\
              ([], [1,2,3,4], [5]), ([], [2,3,4,5], [1]), ([], [1,3,4,5], [2]), ([], [1,2,4,5], [3]), ([], [1,2,3,5], [4]), \}}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We can count 28 outcomes in $A_1$, thus $P(A_1) = \frac{\lvert A_1 \rvert}{\lvert \Omega \rvert} = \frac{28}{243} \approx .1152263374 \approx 11.5226 \%$  

## (b) at most one box remains empty  
We are looking for the subset of outcomes where at most one box remains empty, i.e. all outcomes but ones where two boxes are empty.  
We have the outcomes where two boxes are empty:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \Omega \backslash A_2 = \{{([], [], [1,2,3,4,5]), ([], [1,2,3,4,5], []), ([1,2,3,4,5], [], []) \}}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We can count 3 outcomes in $\Omega \backslash A_2$, thus $P(A_2) = \frac{\lvert \Omega \rvert - \lvert \Omega \backslash A_2 \rvert}{\lvert \Omega \rvert} = \frac{243-3}{243} = \frac{80}{81} \approx ..98765432 \approx 98.7654 \%$  

## (a) box I and II remains empty  
The subset of outcomes where box I remains empty is:  
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    A_3 = \{{([], [], [1,2,3,4,5]) \}}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We can count 1 outcomes in $A_3$, thus $P(A_3) = \frac{\lvert A_3 \rvert}{\lvert \Omega \rvert} = \frac{1}{243} \approx 4.115226337e^{-3} \approx 0.4115 \%$  

# **Question 2**  

We have the sample space as follow:  
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \Omega = \{{W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, \\ 
                Y, Y, Y, Y, Y,  \\
                B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B\}}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We are looking for $P(Y \mid B^c) = \frac{P(Y \cap B^c)}{P(B^c)}$, based on the definition of conditional probability.  

We have:  
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    B^c & = \{{W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, W, \\ 
               Y, Y, Y, Y, Y \}} \\
    \text{thus} \\
    Y \cap B^c & = \{{Y, Y, Y, Y, Y \}}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Therefore: 
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    P(Y \mid B^c) & = \frac{P(Y \cap B^c)}{P(B^c)}  \\
                  & = \frac{\frac{\lvert Y \cap B^c \rvert}{\lvert \Omega \rvert}}
                      {\frac{\lvert B^c \rvert}{\lvert \Omega \rvert}} \\
                  & = \frac{\frac{5}{25}}{\frac{15}{25}} \\
                  & = \frac{1}{3} \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
